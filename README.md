# Website Change Detector 🌐

> A self-hosted program, which detects when a website's contents are updated (a website has changed) and notifies you about it.


## TODO:

 - [ ] Ability to add more websites to the list without stopping the program.
 - [ ] Check for constant changes ( aka ∆change ) daily.
 - [ ] Generate the before and after screenshots (much like how Visualping does).
